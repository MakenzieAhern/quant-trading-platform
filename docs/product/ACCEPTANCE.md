# v1.2 acceptance ledger

Status vocabulary: PASS (direct evidence), FAIL (observed defect), IN_PROGRESS,
NOT_RUN, EXTERNAL_BLOCKED. Code existence/test count alone never proves a user flow.
This ledger is cumulative; no required row may disappear to manufacture completion.

Baseline 2026-09-22: DESKTOP-3EOROGR, Ubuntu WSL2, Docker 4.92, Chrome (existing
profile), v1.1.0 `f88b5c6`, populated local PostgreSQL. Agent walkthrough only.

Four-board job `164c947d` had 3 new + 1 cached candidates. Targeted control retry `ed796871` added two 2026-09-22 vendor candidates: 688622 isST=1; 603400 suspended with blank raw turnover normalized to zero, never executable. Chrome visually confirmed official SSE 603400 suspension notice; binary checksum unavailable. Execution authority remains false; failure/retry browser and full 2026 authority remain | IN_PROGRESS |

## 2026-09-23 15:16 UTC unplanned backend interruption and localized recovery

The agent started historical account `07d72259-4491-4ad6-8ebc-4c8a2a8ae156`
and restarted the real backend while it was RUNNING. After the restart the
server reported `INTERRUPTED`, completed market date 2011-03-11, last sequence
22, zero orders and zero fills; a later read returned the same sequence and
counts. It did not auto-resume. Real Chrome showed the interruption in Chinese,
an explicit new-session action, and a collapsed raw English diagnostic retained
for audit. This is a fail-closed historical replay check, not proof of complete
crash recovery or a forward market session. The frontend suite passed 191 tests,
lint, typecheck and production build. Agent walkthrough only.

## 2026-09-23 15:21 UTC shared load-error review

The shared resource hook now preserves typed `ApiError` information instead of
discarding it into a raw English string. One shared panel distinguishes
offline, timeout, denied and missing-record states in both locales, retains
the original diagnostic behind a disclosure, and offers reload or workbench
navigation. Chrome opened a genuinely nonexistent research dataset and showed
Chinese not-found guidance and a working `/` exit. A focused timeout test and
the complete 193-test frontend suite, lint, typecheck and build passed. This
does not validate the remaining offline/permission/empty-state browser matrix.

## 2026-09-23 15:29 UTC bounded current ST/suspension control

The first two-security job failed closed on a real BaoStock suspended row with
empty volume/amount strings. A targeted direct provider inspection established
the exact shape. Parser v2 accepts only the explicit suspended/both-empty
case and leaves raw fields immutable; active or half-empty rows still fail.
Focused isolated tests passed 50/50; full isolated backend 958 PASS with one
optional archive test skipped, Ruff/format/mypy PASS. After restarting only the idle backend,
retry job `ed796871-4ce4-4cf3-b7f0-2223e636bb75` completed two requests,
two candidate observations and zero unresolved dates. `CN-A:SSE:603400` is
vendor-suspended with zero normalized turnover; `CN-A:SSE:688622` has vendor
ST flag 1. Neither is execution-eligible. The parser-label caveat, immutable
manifest checksums and remaining official-source gaps are in SOURCE_READINESS.
The Chrome report export produced a prepared blob/link but no verified file
download event or artifact; U4-EXPORT remains IN_PROGRESS.

## 2026-09-23 14:57 UTC paper pause/restart/resume checkpoint

Chrome created audited historical account `4b64380f-85ff-4696-a710-a8d92725bc0b`
with an explicitly edited 2011-03-23 end date; the server persisted that date.
The agent started it, paused after completed session 2011-03-09 (19 ledger
events, no fills), restarted the real backend, and observed the same PAUSED
state, cursor, ledger count and connected browser. Resume completed on
2011-03-23. Against uninterrupted account `d7044a3c-7ef3-46ba-accd-197a6d40505e`,
all 134 non-status event type/payload pairs match in order; both have 20 orders,
six fills and equity `99964.8134`. The resumed ledger adds exactly four
pause/resume status events. This is historical replay, not a forward market
receipt. The Chrome review also found untranslated order enum values; U8 remains
FAIL. Native date inputs in paper, guided research, market updates, collections
and market detail now handle `input` events; related frontend tests and the
actual Chrome paper form submission passed.

Main database migration0015 followed a verified off-Git pre-migration backup
`/home/yuchen/data/backups/quant_platform_pre0015_20260923T1443Z.dump`
(SHA-256 `0f751cb54be0d939fdd76d4ed01b5f6c75591fd9f59d634ca10cbcebd3effd57`).
A separate disposable PostgreSQL instance passed upgrade0014→0015,
downgrade0015→0014, re-upgrade and `alembic check`. Do not downgrade the live
database while it contains PAUSED/PAUSING rows. No frozen research files changed.

## 2026-09-23 15:08 UTC focused Chinese/English closure

The Chrome review of the completed historical paper account exposed raw
`BUY / LIMIT`, `CANCELLED` and `proposal approved` values in Chinese. Paper
signal/order/fill directions, order types/statuses and known risk reasons and
diagnostics now use the current locale while persisted event payloads remain
unchanged. Chrome reloaded the same 20-order/six-fill account and showed
`买入 / 限价单`, `已成交`/`已取消`, `风控通过` and Chinese diagnostic text. The legacy
`/backtests/new` form, previously wholly English, now renders Chinese labels,
validation and help. Chrome language switching retained the exact typed
capital `123456.789`. This is an agent walkthrough, not a real new-user test;
untranslated server-supplied errors and the wider U8 matrix are still open.

## 2026-09-22 09:27 UTC cached-market browser closure

`u5/markets-zh-light-390-context-fixed.png` and `u5/markets-zh-dark-1280.png`
under the evidence root show the actual Chrome UI. Parent and detail both wrote
the topbar data context: opening showed an experiment-style requested date and
closing erased the selected archive. A regression failed on this mismatch;
the page now owns the context alone, retaining archive2025-12-31 (or explicitly
synthetic2031-12-31) through open/close. Requested dates remain in the detail.
Board/exchange names are translated without changing their API identifiers.

The prior U2 cross-tab draft overwrite is resolved with independently retained
per-page recovery slots. Exact saved version and restore behavior was checked in
Chrome; the three-way comparison was also refreshed in Chrome. These checks are
agent walkthroughs, not real new-user research.

## 2026-09-23 00:52 UTC incremental candidate checkpoint

Migration0014 was checked with upgrade/downgrade/upgrade and Alembic check on the
isolated test DB. The main database received the additive migration after a
validated off-repo backup. Backend949/frontend182 tests, Ruff, strict mypy,
ESLint, TypeScript and build passed. Chrome submitted exactly one explicit
BaoStock request for `CN-A:SSE:600000` on 2026-09-22. Job
`3b729cf9-32e2-4945-9a81-05b08685fc6e` completed one provider request with
one raw candidate observation and receipt `4eb082e8-4b06-4a63-8197-acfa0f6073d1`.
Manifest SHA-256 `5db56749ffe589cc34184ea741739cddce57eaec0b8ea150a770b46f28924dff`
matches the independent product volume file. The browser reopened that same
task after backend restart with unchanged counts; the screenshot is
`u5/incremental-raw-receipt-zh-20260923.png` outside Git. Formal ledger counts
remain 1 dataset/3 runs/310 trades and frozen manifest/freeze hashes unchanged.
This is a historical candidate update, not trading authority or a forward
simulation receipt after user-session start. U6/U7 and the full matrix remain.

## 2026-09-23 U6 historical preview checkpoint

The actual historical exploratory job `d9f27183-a9a1-4f34-aef4-eba439f53374`
finished 293/293 accepted sessions through 2011-03-22. Its saved preview uses
only completed-session raw closes and the accepted calendar's next date,
2011-03-23. Replayed cash `45539.94836`, equity `104666.94836`, and 16 holdings
exactly match the persisted final holdings endpoint. The preview records 32
candidates and five risk rejections; approved-buy cash `44221.44166` is an
estimate at the completed close, not an executable next-open amount. No paper
order was submitted. An insufficient-warmup test produces no usable plan.

Chrome rendered the real result and plan in Chinese and English. At 390×844,
the whole page has no horizontal overflow; the candidate table scrolls locally
with an explicit bilingual hint. Agent screenshots (not real-user evidence) are
outside Git at `u6/plan-zh-dark-desktop.png` and
`u6/plan-en-dark-mobile-390.png`. This is U6 replay preview evidence, **not**
completion of the independent U7 account, genuinely new-market forward mode,
or U6 submission to a simulated account.
